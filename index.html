    <p>
      A technology enthusiest, I have been fascinated by computers since my father helped me build my first computer at four years old. He worked hard to ensure that I would be knowledgable in a future where coding and tech would be integrated everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my professional career I have worked for a SaaS tech company for four years, starting as a Technical Support Engineer working with our techs to fix bugs for our customers. I have since moved on to being a Solutions Engineer, working with business parters to integrate with our software. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion is problem solving and finding efficient solutions to daily problems. Nothing makes me happier than empowering others to be confident in their ability to navigate the software world.
